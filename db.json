        "description": "Dodge only builds three vehicles at this point, one of them being the big, burly Challenger two-door. Retro styling makes it one of the better-looking vehicles on sale, especially with the enormous tires and fender flares that come with the Challenger Widebody. Dodge introduced the Challenger way back in 2008 and gave the muscle car a major refresh for 2015; changes for 2022 are limited to a new alarm system. The Challenger competes with other American performance coupes like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro as well as foreign competitors like the Nissan Z.",

        "description": "Porsche made AWD standard on all base-engine 2022 Macans, and the same is true for the 2023 Macan T. Except on the new Macan T, the AWD system biases its power toward the rear axle to help keep you moving during enthusiastic driving. Trim-specific anti-roll bars and an active suspension system should help limit body roll, though we look forward to evaluating that for ourselves.",

Most recently, however, the Z4 shares its origins with the latest Supra, which was co-developed by Toyota and built on the same platform. The Z4 is more comfortable on a highway than a track, but its engines still offer plenty of charm.",
